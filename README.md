# CLox
CLox is a high level language that uses byte-code interpretation technique for execution. VM is stack based. All code written in good old C.

## How to build and run
To create `clox` executable just run:
```
make 
```
To run compiled application, just execute:
```
make run
```

## High level architecture

### Lexer
Creates tokens from source code stream.

### Compiler.
Uses Lexer stream of tokens to generate bytecode representation. Compiler uses `Pratt's` top-down parsing technique.

### VM
Stack based VM that executes generated bytecode.

#### Supported VM instructions
